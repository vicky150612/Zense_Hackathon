##  Problem Statement

Almost all IIITB students are tired of navigating through multiple websites for different purposes—checking menus, finding lost items, getting updates from clubs, and staying informed about events. The absence of a centralized student platform leads to fragmented communication and inefficiency. IIIT-Blare solves this by integrating all essential student resources into a single, cohesive platform.
